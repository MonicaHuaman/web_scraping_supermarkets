# web_scraping_supermarkets
This project was created with the purpose of extracting prices from Ahorramas and Día supermarkets using python. 

I provide a brief description of how it works:

1) web_scrp_func.py: There are the functions to perform the webscrapping of the web pages, which are used later.
2) wbscp_supermarkets.py: It is the main code for data extraction, it uses web_scrp_func.py as input and exports excel files with the information of Ahorramas and Día supermarkets to the Downloads folder.
3) Downloads : Folder in which the Ahorramas and Día information is exported in excel files that contain the day and time of extraction.
3) requirements.txt : You can find the modules and their versions ready to be installed.
